üß† MRI of Brain Tumors

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for detecting and analyzing brain tumors. Unlike CT scans, MRI provides highly detailed images of brain tissue without radiation exposure.

üîç Key Points

High Contrast Resolution: MRI can differentiate between normal brain tissue, tumor tissue, edema (swelling), and necrosis (dead tissue).

Multi-Sequence Imaging: Different MRI sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR, contrast-enhanced) highlight unique features of tumors:

T1-weighted: Good for anatomical details.

T2-weighted / FLAIR: Show tumor boundaries and edema.

Contrast-enhanced (Gadolinium): Tumors often enhance due to disrupted blood‚Äìbrain barrier.

Tumor Characterization: MRI helps in identifying tumor type, size, shape, and location.

Pre-Surgical Planning: Provides neurosurgeons with critical information about tumor margins and involvement of nearby structures.

Follow-up & Monitoring: MRI is used to track tumor progression, treatment response, or recurrence after surgery/radiotherapy.
