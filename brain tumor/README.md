# AI-Driven Brain Tumor Analysis System

This project aims to create an AI-driven system for analyzing brain tumor MRI scans.  The system will automate several key steps in the diagnostic process, improving efficiency and accuracy.

## Functionality

The system will:

1. **Accept MRI Scans:** Allow users to upload MRI scans.
2. **Tumor Detection & Segmentation:** Automatically detect and segment tumor regions within the scans.
3. **Tumor Classification:** Classify the tumor type and grade/stage.
4. **Medical Summary:** Generate a concise medical summary describing tumor characteristics.
5. **Surgical Approach Suggestion:** Suggest possible surgical approaches (minor vs. major), emphasizing that final decisions rest with medical professionals.

## Technology Stack

- **TypeScript:** For robust and scalable code.
